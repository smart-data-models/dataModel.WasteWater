# dataModel.WasteWater

### List of data models

The following entity types are available:
- [Blower](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.WasteWater/blob/master/Blower/README.md). This entity contains an harmonised description of a Blower made for the Wastewater treatment domain. The entity represents a Blower that are used for aeration purposes in the wastewater treatment process. Important parameters are measured to regulate and measure the amount of airflow is being provided to the aeration tank in the bioreactor. Energy consumption of a blower is also important information for real-time control and optimisation of the wastewater treatment plant.

- [OffGasStack](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.WasteWater/blob/master/OffGasStack/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic Off-gas Stack made for the Wastewater treatment domain. This entity represents stacks that are present in some wastewater treatment plants where the emissions, greenhouse gases included, are emitted.

- [WaterProcess](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.WasteWater/blob/master/WaterProcess/README.md). The data model is intended to provide information about water process at water purification plant or water treatment plant

- [WasteWaterJunction](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.WasteWater/blob/master/WasteWaterJunction/README.md). This entity contains an harmonised description of a generic Junction made for the Wastewater treatment domain. Junctions could be in place in certain sections of thetreatment plant. In wastewater treatment purposes, the junction is most useful if it is a locationof a sensor that measures a specific variable.

- [WasteWaterPlant](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.WasteWater/blob/master/WasteWaterPlant/README.md). Data model for waste water treatment plant.

- [WasteWaterSimulationResult](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.WasteWater/blob/master/WasteWaterSimulationResult/README.md). This entity contains an harmonised description of a WasteWaterSimulationResults made for the Wastewater treatment domain. The entity contains properties that are parameters which have been predicted or forecasted by models through a simulation.

- [WasteWaterTank](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.WasteWater/blob/master/WasteWaterTank/README.md). This entity contains an harmonised description of a generic Tank made for the Wastewater treatment domain. For a given type of tank, all possible variables that can be measures are listed as properties. In the description property, the type of tank (anaerobic, pre-dinitrification, nitrification etc.)can be defined.
